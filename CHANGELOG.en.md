# sysenv Changelog

Versioned record of new features / fixes / release conventions. Artifact naming: `sysenv-<platform>-<arch>_v<version>`, release binaries compressed with UPX (see README "Build & Release").

## v0.3.0 (2026-10-05)

### Added
- `sysenv ai chat --list-model`: lists **all model names** in the config file's `clients` section (grouped by provider, with weights); `--list-provider`: lists all providers (name / type / model count). Both may be combined and require no message.
- `sysenv ai chat -m/--model MODEL`: **temporarily overrides** the top-level `model`, using the exact same rules (`{provider}:{model}` / `{provider}:*` / bare `{model}` / comma-separated multi-select).
- Both the top-level `model` and `-m` accept **multiple selectors separated by half-width `,` or full-width `，`**, used in weighted rotation (e.g. `agnes:*,claude:claude-3-5-sonnet`).
- **Dynamic weighted rotation**: model `weight` now ranges 0-9 (default 1). On request failure, if `weight > 1` the value is decremented by 1 and **written back to the config file**, then the next model is tried automatically; on a fallback success, if `weight < 9` it is incremented by 1 and written back. Both the conventional `weight:` sub-key and the mangled standalone `- weight: N` form are handled, preserving indentation and trailing comments.
- `sysenv ai model`: text tables gained `CONTEXT` (context length) and `TYPE` (modality) columns; new `--model-type TYPE` filter: `text / image / audio / video / pdf` (Chinese aliases `文本 / 图像 / 语音 / 视频` accepted), matched against `modalities.input/output`.
- `sysenv ai cn-model`: list tables gained a `TYPE` (category) column; new `--model-type TYPE` filter: `text / image / audio / video / multimodal` (Chinese aliases accepted), matched against card categories (e.g. `audio` → 语音大模型, `image` → vision / multimodal). **Exact single-model hits now fetch the detail page**, outputting `context` (e.g. `1.05M`) and `modality` (e.g. `文本、图像 → 文本`), degrading silently on failure; CSV extended to 10 columns (added `context,modality`).
- Robustness: config parsing now strips a UTF-8 BOM so a leading top-level `model` key is not silently lost.

### Notes
- Existing `chat_state.json` rotation state remains compatible (a comma-containing selector is keyed as one string).
